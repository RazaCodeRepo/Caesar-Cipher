# Caesar-Cipher
This software provides a two-key encryption/decryption implementation of the Caesar Cipher. The logic is spread across three 
different classes. One class contains the implementation of the cipher and invoking its instance on any given text file can result
in its encrypted equivalent. The decryption logic is contained in a seperate class and wrapper logic mainly dealing with user input
is contained in a third class. Overall, this project consists of the following three source files:
-autoDecryption.java
-CaesarCipherTwo.java
-TestCaesarCipherTwo.java

Details of the cipher itself along with a demo video of the software can be seen on the project wiki page:
